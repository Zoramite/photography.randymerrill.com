In celebration of the 65th anniversary of the US Air Force, Vandenberg Air Force Base hosted an anniversary ball on the 5th of October at the Pacific Coast Club.

Guests of the event started the night with a customary cocktail hour. Dinner chimes summoned the guests to enter the ballroom through an honorary full saber arch.

The dinner was preceded by the traditional dinner toasts and an exemplary MIA/POW tribute by the Vandenberg Honor Guard. To add some extra flair to the event, the most senior and junior airmen cut an Air Force birthday cake using a saber.

The real treat of the night was guest speaker, General (Ret) Lance W. Lordâ€”previous Commander of the 30th Space Wing and Western Range (1993-1995) and Air Force Space Command. His thoughts on leadership were inspiring to all.

In honor of General (Ret) Lord and his wife, a donation of $500 was made to the [Susan G Komen for the cure][komen].

To crown the ball, a live band performed while guests danced the night away. And dance they did!
